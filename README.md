# LUDO
LUDO is a game made in Python 3.9.0 by Ishaan Sharma.

# How to play
How to play:
- The players roll a six-sided die in turns and can advance any of their coins on the track by the number of steps as displayed by the dice.
- Once you get a six in a dice throw, you have to roll the dice again, and must use all scores while making the final selection of what coins to move where.
- If you get a six three times in a row, your throws are reset and you will lose that chance.
- The coin can advance in the home run only if it reaches exactly inside the home pocket, or moves closer to it through the home run. 
For example, if the coin is four squares away from the home pocket and the player rolls a five, he must apply the throw to some other coin.
However, if you roll a two, you can advance the coin by two squares and then it rests there until the next move.

# Your Goal
Your goal should be to get all of your coins into the home pocket, and the moment your coins are in the home pocket you are the winner!
